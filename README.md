# Why Its just an april fools game?
**Simple, the devs are censoring only one political side of political speech.**

They came first for the Communists,
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Communist.

Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews,
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Jew.

Then they came for me,
and by that time no one was left to speak up.
